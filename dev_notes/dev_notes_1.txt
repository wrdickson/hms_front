Notes for 3/21/23

Look at hms_front spaceEdit.updateSpace() and how it calls api.rootSpaces.updateRootSpace to see how we should be doing loading signals to the user and how we should be doing error handling.

While we are making progress on config object editing to ensure that we do not corrupt the data, we have a long way to go.  Most of the work is in root space edit, where it is important to notice the injudicious use of the monster method Reservations::update_space_codes to adjust existing reservations.  At least, we should generate a return to be handled on the front end.  Right now, it operates in the blind on the server, and we have no idea if the execution was correct.

Also, in resView3 create reservation, it seems like we need to update available spaces from the getgo when editing a reservations.  If the user does not change the dates, the data in the space selector is not up to date.  The getaround is simply to change the date, then change it back to original, but this sucks.
